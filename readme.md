# MERN with Firebase Auth

This is the project based from one of bradtraversy's udemy courses, "React Front To Back 2022".
I've learnt a lot handy frontend skills from this course. (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/)

Plus, I want to add some functions and components to this project with few skill what I got recently like 'MERN stack and Firebase Authentication fn'.
